    # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
    # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
    # the material Icons class.
    uses-material-design: true
    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    assets:
        - .env
        - assets/
        - assets/images/
        - assets/icons/
        - assets/lottie/
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    fonts:
        - family: drawerhead
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Glitten-Regular.ttf
                weight: 400
        - family: drawerheading
          fonts:
              - asset: assets/fonts/Galvin-Regular.ttf
                weight: 400
              - asset: assets/fonts/Galvin-Light.ttf
                weight: 300
              - asset: assets/fonts/Galvin-Light.ttf
                weight: 400
                style: italic
              - asset: assets/fonts/Galvin-Bold.ttf
                weight: 700
              - asset: assets/fonts/Galvin-BoldItalic.ttf
                weight: 700
                style: italic
          #  - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf
    #          weight: 700
    #        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-BoldItalic.ttf
    #          weight: 700
